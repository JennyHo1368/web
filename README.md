# CIST 2931 - Advance System Projects
Group #3

## Goals:
In this project you will create a Web Application that may be used by a Customer, 
looking to purchase Consumer Electronics online, as well as an internal Order Processing 
Person, whose job is to fulfill the on-line orders placed by Customers.

A Customer Should be able to:
1.    Search Consumer Electronics 
2.    Make a Purchase without creating a Customer Account
3.    Create a new Customer Account
4.    Login, Search Products and make purchases with their Customer Account
5.    Change the information in their Customer Account, like Address, etc.

An Order Processing Person Should be able to:
1.    Login 
2.    View a list of orders that need to be fulfilled
3.    Change the state of an order from Open to Ready to Shipped/Picked-up

You will need to complete this Project as a Team.  You will need to start from scratch, 
that is no database is provided, no code is provided.  You should probably start with an 
OOAD(Object Oriented Analysis & Design).  And go from there.

The Instructor will act as your Client, that is the Person that you will deliver your 
software to.  You can ask specific questions of the Client(Instructor) to guide you in 
your project design and coding

Futhermore, communicate effectively with each other and give it our all!!
